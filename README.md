# neural-network-visualizer

Interactive visualization tool for understanding how neural networks learn.  Implements backpropagation from scratch using pure NumPy, allowing users to experiment with network architecture and see real-time decision boundaries on classic ML datasets (XOR, Spirals, Circles).

Built from scratch to demonstrate the mathematics behind deep learning.
